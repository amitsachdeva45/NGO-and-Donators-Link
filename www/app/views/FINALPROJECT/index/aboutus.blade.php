	<h1>About "LIGHT the FUTURE"</h1>
	<p>     
	 LIGHT the FUTURE aims to work with grassroots initiatives for effecting positive changes in the lives of underprivileged children, their families and communities.<br><br>

	 LIGHT the FUTURE is to deploy best possible methodology and technology to practice and promote good governance. To link business competitiveness of the corporate with social development initiatives; also to sensitize privileged children, youth and citizens in general to promote Civic Driven Change.<br><br>

	 We believes that education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues â€“ from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen. Education is the most effective tool which helps children build a strong foundation; enabling them to free themselves from the vicious cycle of ignorance, poverty and disease.<br><br>

	 We believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the process of development, sustainable change will not happen. Believing in this principle of 'Civic Driven Change', Smile Foundation sensitises the civil society in order to make them partners in its mission.
