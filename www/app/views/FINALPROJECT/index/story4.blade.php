Pooja is a happy and vivacious little girl living with her mother and sisters in a village of Madhya Pradesh. Her life today is a striking contrast from her journey with pain and sickness.
Pooja was two years old when her father Santhram died of cancer. Her mother, Rajkumari, struggled to take care of her three children. It was at this time that Pooja was included in World Vision child sponsorship programme. Child sponsorship enabled Pooja to have access to education and health care.
When Pooja was in the 3rd std., she became progressively weak over a period of three years. It came to a point where she could hardly walk. She experienced a severe burning pain in her chest.
Due to superstitious beliefs, Rajkumari refused to take her to the doctor. World Vision’s staff convinced her, and Pooja was taken to a hospital, 25 km away from the village. The diagnosis was Bone Tuberculosis. After 3 months of treatment, Pooja returned to her village, a healthy young girl. She is now in the 5th std. and aspires to be a teacher.
