Well said by ANNE FRANK <br>
<br>"No one has ever become poor from giving"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we provide assistance to people by our services,it can inspire others to learn tha tthose who do the most for others are happiest one.They will learnt that charity never made poor,stealing never made rich and health never made wise.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charity will benefit our phychological and emotional well being.The act of helping others can create as improved sense of well being.It provide us inner satisfication when we sacrifice something such as time,finance or property in order to help them.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually,when we raise the standard of living for the least ble among us,we raise our own standard of living in turn.

<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have started our services at our own level and surely improve also by recieving help from people who have surplus money.
